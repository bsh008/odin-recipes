<p>A sweet cake soaked in 3 milks and topped with a whipped icing</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>For Cake:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>5 whole eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar, divided</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
    <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
    <li>1 can sweetened, condensed milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
</ul>
<h4>For Icing</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups cool whip or whipped cream</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vanilla butter cream frosting</li>
</ul> 
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>reheat oven to 350˚. Spray a 9 x 13 inch pan liberally until coated.
    <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Separate eggs.</li>
    <li>Beat egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. 
        Stir in milk and vanilla. Pour egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and 
        stir very gently until combined.
    </li>
    <li>Beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. With the mixer on, 
        pour in remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until egg whites are stiff but not dry.
    </li>
    <li>Fold egg white mixture into the batter very gently until just combined. 
        Pour into prepared pan and spread to even out the surface.
    </li>
    <li>Bake for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. 
        Turn cake out onto a rimmed platter and allow to cool.</li>
    <li>Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream in a small pitcher.
        When cake is cool, pierce the surface with a fork several times. 
        Slowly drizzle all but about 1 cup of the milk mixture—try to get as much around the edges of the cake as you can.
    </li> 
    <li>Allow the cake to absorb the milk mixture for 30 minutes. 
        To ice the cake, fold whipped cream with slightly warmed buttercream frosting until thick and spreadable.</li>
    <li>Spread over the surface of the cake. (optional Decorate cake with whole or chopped maraschino cherries.) Cut into squares and serve.</li>
</ol>
